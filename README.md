# EasyScrollPicker - An adjustable scroll picker library for Android.

The main advantage of this library is that there are no pre-declared supported modifiers such as size, opacity, color, etc. This library allows you to apply any modification to your VieHolder depending on position: central, left-right, or other. You have a dynamic relative number of views on screen, so you can modify it depending on your relative position.
