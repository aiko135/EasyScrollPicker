# EasyScrollPicker
An adjustable scroll picker library for Android.

WIP

# DRAFT
The main advantage of this library is that there are no pre-declared supported modifiers such as size, opacity, color, etc. This library allows you to apply any modification on your VieHolder depending on position: central, left-right, or other. You have dynamic relative number of view on screen so you can modify it depending on relative position.
